		<p><strong>Keep calm and carrion</strong>: Zoo marks Vulture Day - The Oregon Zoo will celebrate International Vulture Awareness Day on Saturday, Sept. 2, showcasing California condors, turkey vultures and other "master recyclers," and highlighting the critical role vultures play in ecosystems around the world.</p>
    <p>At 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., visitors can stop by the zoo's Condors of the Columbia habitat for keeper talks and up-close views of these colorful, charismatic and critically endangered birds. Though native to the region, and commonly seen here during the time of Lewis and Clark, California condors haven't soared through Northwest skies for more than a century. Volunteers will be on hand throughout the day, providing information about these enormous birds and the actions we can take to protect them. </p>

		<p><strong>Four ways to help elephants on World Elephant Day</strong>: Around the world, elephants are facing serious trouble. An estimated 35,000 African elephants are killed each year for their tusks, fueling an illegal ivory market and rapidly driving the world's largest land animal toward extinction. In Asia, it's even more dire — only about 40,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants total remain, living in fragmented populations from India to Borneo.</p>

    <p>On World Elephant Day, Aug. 12, here are four ways to make a difference.</p>

    <p>1. <strong>Urge companies to commit to deforestation-free palm oil.</strong> Palm oil is the world's most popular vegetable oil, used in everyday products like toothpaste, chocolate bars and lipstick. When tropical habitats are destroyed to produce it, Asian elephants and many other species can be left homeless. The Oregon Zoo's own Chendra was orphaned this way. Let companies know the use of deforestation-free palm oil is important to elephants and important to you.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Look for the FSC-certified logo.</strong> Whether you're purchasing a desk, printer paper or napkins, look for the Forest Stewardship Council label to help ensure your wood product is "friendly" to elephants and the forests they inhabit.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Add to the zoo's Asian elephant conservation endowment.</strong> Last year, the zoo earmarked $1 million to establish a permanent, self-sustaining source of funds specifically dedicated to helping Asian elephants. To contribute or learn about other ways to get involved, call 503-914-6029.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Spread the word. Once you've taken action, let people know.</strong> Talk to your friends and reach out to your social media networks. Use the hashtag #WorldElephantDay, and let people know why we should help as well as how we can.</p>

    <p>The Oregon Zoo is recognized worldwide for its Asian elephant program, which has spanned more than 60 years. Considered highly endangered in their range countries, Asian elephants are threatened by habitat loss, conflict with humans and disease. Through the International Elephant Foundation and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the zoo supports a broad range of elephant conservation efforts to help wild elephants.</p>

		<p><strong>5 things you should know about palm oil.</strong>: Palm oil is the most popular vegetable oil in the world, and the cheapest to produce. It's used in thousands of products, from cookies to lipstick. Indonesia and Malaysia produce about 85 percent of the world's supply, using roughly 53,800 square miles – half the size of Oregon.</p>

    <p>The cost: the palm oil industry destroys vital habitats for increasingly endangered orangutans, tigers, Asian elephants and sun bears.</p>

    <p>Here are five things wildlife advocates need to know about the issue.</p>

    <p>1. <strong>You likely consumed palm oil today without knowing it</strong> Palm oil is in an estimated half of all packaged food products sold in American grocery stores. It's in the majority of cosmetics. Most baby formulas, laundry detergents, chocolate bars, toothpastes and shampoos contain palm oil. It can even be found in products as seemingly "additive-free" as cow's milk.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Ingredient labels won't always tell you which products contain palm oil</strong>There are hundreds of names for palm oil and its derivatives. An ingredient is derived from palm oil if it includes the word "palm" in it (with the exception of hearts of palm), such as palmate or palmitate. An ingredient may be derived from palm oil if it includes the words "lauryl," "laureth," the prefix "stear-," "vegetable oil," "glycerin" or "emulsifier," to name a few. Grab the closest product to you right now. Is palm oil an ingredient?</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Boycotting palm oil won't save forests or wildlife</strong>If consumers boycotted palm oil, companies would buy alternative oils that may require up to nine times as much land to produce. Meanwhile, palm oil growers will have even less incentive to produce responsible palm oil. The United States uses only a fraction of the world's supply of palm oil. The vast majority of it is used as cooking oil in China and Southeast Asia. A boycott of palm oil in the U.S. would have little to no impact on global palm oil use.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Responsibly produced palm oil does exist</strong> Palm oil producers don't have to cut down forests. They can use degraded land instead of forested land. They can plant higher-yield species of oil palm trees. But they won't do it unless their buyers insist. Unlike dolphin-safe tuna or FSC-certified wood, there's no logo for wildlife-friendly palm oil.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>When consumers demand responsible palm oil, companies take action</strong> Some American companies like Mars, Smuckers and General Mills have committed to using only deforestation-free palm oil. Others have done little or nothing to cut deforestation from their supply chains. Before you shop, do some research. Identify and buy products from companies that have committed to deforestation-free palm oil. Speak out to businesses that still don't.</p>
